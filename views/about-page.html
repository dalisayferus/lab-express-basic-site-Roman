        <h2>Bio:</h2>
        <p>
          known for his cerebral, often nonlinear, storytelling, acclaimed
          writer-director Christopher Nolan was born on July 30, 1970, in
          London, England. Over the course of 15 years of filmmaking, Nolan has
          gone from low-budget independent films to working on some of the
          biggest blockbusters ever made.
          <br /><br />
          At 7 years old, Nolan began making short movies with his father's
          Super-8 camera. While studying English Literature at University
          College London, he shot 16-millimeter films at U.C.L.'s film society,
          where he learned the guerrilla techniques he would later use to make
          his first feature, Following (1998), on a budget of around $6,000. The
          noir thriller was recognized at a number of international film
          festivals prior to its theatrical release and gained Nolan enough
          credibility that he was able to gather substantial financing for his
          next film.
          <br /><br />
          Nolan's second film was Memento (2000), which he directed from his own
          screenplay based on a short story by his brother Jonathan. Starring
          Guy Pearce, the film brought Nolan numerous honors, including Academy
          Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay.
          Nolan went on to direct the critically acclaimed psychological
          thriller, Insomnia (2002), starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and
          Hilary Swank.
          <br /><br />
          The turning point in Nolan's career occurred when he was awarded the
          chance to revive the Batman franchise in 2005. In Batman Begins
          (2005), Nolan brought a level of gravitas back to the iconic hero, and
          his gritty, modern interpretation was greeted with praise from fans
          and critics alike. Before moving on to a Batman sequel, Nolan
          directed, co-wrote, and produced the mystery thriller The Prestige
          (2006), starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as magicians whose
          obsessive rivalry leads to tragedy and murder.
          <br /><br />
          In 2008, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced The Dark Knight (2008)
          which went on to gross more than a billion dollars at the worldwide
          box office. Nolan was nominated for a Directors Guild of America
          (D.G.A.) Award, Writers Guild of America (W.G.A.) Award and Producers
          Guild of America (P.G.A.) Award, and the film also received eight
          Academy Award nominations.
          <br /><br />
          In 2010, Nolan captivated audiences with the sci-fi thriller Inception
          (2010), which he directed and produced from his own original
          screenplay. The thought-provoking drama was a worldwide blockbuster,
          earning more than $800,000,000 and becoming one of the most discussed
          and debated films of the year. Among its many honors, Inception
          received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including Best
          Picture and Best Screenplay. Nolan was recognized by his peers with
          D.G.A. and P.G.A. Award nominations, as well as a W.G.A. Award for his
          work on the film.
          <br /><br />
          One of the best-reviewed and highest-grossing movies of 2012, The Dark
          Knight Rises (2012) concluded Nolan's Batman trilogy. Due to his
          success rebooting the Batman character, Warner Bros. enlisted Nolan to
          produce their revamped Superman movie Man of Steel (2013), which
          opened in the summer of 2013. In 2014, Nolan directed, wrote, and
          produced the science-fiction epic Interstellar (2014), starring
          Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain. Paramount
          Pictures and Warner Bros. released the film on November 5, 2014, to
          positive reviews and strong box-office results, grossing over $670
          million dollars worldwide.
          <br /><br />
          Nolan resides in Los Angeles, California with his wife, producer Emma
          Thomas, and their children. Nolan and Thomas also have their own
          production company, Syncopy.
